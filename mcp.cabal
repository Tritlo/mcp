-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

synopsis:           A Haskell implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    This library provides a complete implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
    for Haskell. MCP is a protocol that enables seamless communication between AI models
    and external tools, resources, and services. This implementation supports the latest
    MCP protocol version (2025-06-18) with full compatibility for resources, tools,
    prompts, and all standard MCP message types. It provides both a server framework
    and type definitions for building MCP-compliant applications.
    .
    Features dual transport support:
    .
    * StdIO transport for process-based clients (e.g., Claude Desktop)
    * HTTP transport following the official MCP specification for web-based integration,
      and supports OAuth authentication.
    .
    Both transports use the same MCPServer typeclass, allowing seamless switching between
    communication methods while maintaining identical server logic.
